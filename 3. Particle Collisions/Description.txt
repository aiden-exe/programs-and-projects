Inspired by the surprising connection between the number of collisions and the number π, I have
solved a more general problem – only computationally. Consider a set of n point objects located in a
gravity-free one-dimensional universe, where for i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, the i’th object has mass mi ∈ R, and at
time t = 0, it is located at position xi ∈ R and has velocity vi ∈ R. Assume that the objects are numbered
from left to right, that is, x0 < x1 < · · · < xn−1. Given this initial conditions, the objects undergo several
collisions over time and eventually move away from one another. Since there is no external force
involved, by Newton’s law, the total momentum of the objects is conserved during every collision. 

I have assumed that each collision is elastic, and therefore, kinetic energy is conserved too. Also, note that 
can ever “cross” each other, and therefore, collisions can happen only between objects i and i + 1, for some
i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 2}.
