Given a network of routers and connections, we represent the network as a graph with vertices as
routers and the edges as connections. Now. assume a situation where each connection (a 'wire' or a
'broadband') has a particular maximum data transfer rate - we call it the Capacity of the connection.
This gives a weighted graph where each edge is labelled with it's capacity. We develop an algorithm to
find the path between two routers s and t, such the minimum capacity of the path is maximized, i.e., we
can send data through this path faster than any other path.

We have solved this by tweaking the Dijkstra's algorithm to meet the maximation requirement of the problem.
