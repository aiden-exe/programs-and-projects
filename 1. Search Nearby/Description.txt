We have used the ‘search nearby’ feature of Google maps to search for restaurants close
to you. How should Google store the locations of restaurants so that it can answer such queries fast? 
Note that the list of restaurants remains fairly unchanged over time, while ‘search nearby’ queries are much 
more frequent. Therefore, it makes sense to pre-process the list of restaurants and create an appropriate 
data structure that enables processing ‘search nearby’ queries much faster than a brute-force search 
(assuming the number of “nearby” restaurants is much smaller than the total number of restaurants, 
which is typically the case).

We have used a range tree implementation to solve this problem.
